### Game process
The game process is mainly controlled by the front end
1. Score: By default, the maximum score of the robot is 70 points. To avoid the decline of the robot's score, the user's score is>=80 points, so the robot's score is 70 points at most.
2. Judgment: user>=80 points to win. If user<80 points, the robot always wins by 70 points.
3. Judge whether to answer the question: if the user has answered the question and the score is greater than or equal to 80, the historical score will be displayed; If the score is less than 80, answer the question again. If the user does not answer the question, he/she will answer it again.
4. avatar: the avatar and nickname of the user and robot are generated by the front end. If the user has answered the question, save the avatar and nickname and re match the avatar and nickname for the robot. User did not answer the question: match user and robot avatar and nickname.
